## 🎯 Why We Made This

Look, we've all been there. You're prepping for a gig and suddenly realize you have 47 versions of "One More Time" and half your tracks show up as "!" because you moved your music folder again. Frustrating, right?

This little tool is just our attempt to help fellow DJs deal with the chaos. Will it solve all your problems? Probably not. But hopefully it'll save you some time and headaches.
I am aware of other (commercial) tools available, like the excellent Rekordbox Collection Tool (RCT) by MixMasterG, but is Mac only and not open-source. 

### 😤 The Stuff That's Annoying:
- 🎵 **Too Many Duplicates**: Same track, but with slightly different names, cluttering everything
- 📁 **Missing Files**: You know, those dreaded "!" tracks that mess up your flow ![rekordbox-missing-track.png](screenshots/rekordbox-missing-track.png)   
- ⏰ **Time Sink**: Spending more time organizing music than actually mixing it
- 💸 **Expensive Tools**: Why pay hundreds when it should just... work?
- 🔒 **No Control**: Can't tweak things the way *you* want them

### ✨ What We're Trying to Do:
Make a simple, free tool that might help you get your library back under control. No promises, but it's worked for us and hopefully will for you too! 🤞

---

## 🌟 What It Does

### 🔍 **Duplicate Detection** 
- **🎵 Audio Fingerprinting**: Finds identical tracks even when they have different names (pretty cool, right?)
- **📝 Metadata Matching**: Compares artist, title, BPM, key - whatever fields you want
- **🎯 Confidence Scoring**: Shows how sure we are that tracks are actually duplicates
- **🎛️ Your Rules**: Tweak the settings however you like - it's your library!

### 📍 **Track Relocation** *(NEW!)*
- **🔎 Smart Search**: Tries to find your moved music files automatically  
- **🎯 Similarity Matching**: Matches tracks even when filenames are different
- **📁 Bulk Operations**: Fix hundreds of tracks at once (if you're lucky!)
- **⚡ Fast Enough**: Scans through lots of files without making you wait forever
- **⚠️ Unlocatable Tracking**: Marks tracks that couldn't be auto-relocated so you can retry or handle them manually

### 🛠️ **Resolution Options**
- **🏆 Quality-Based**: Keeps the highest bitrate versions (usually what you want)
- **📅 Date-Based**: Keep the newest or oldest files - your choice  
- **📂 Folder Preferences**: Prioritize tracks from certain folders (like keeping FLAC over MP3)
- **✋ Manual Mode**: Check everything yourself if you're the careful type

### 💾 **Remembers Your Stuff** *(NEW!)*
- **🔄 Picks Up Where You Left Off**: No need to start over if you close the app
- **📊 IndexedDB Storage**: Built-in browser storage - no external database needed!
- **⚡ Quick Loading**: Opens right back to where you were
- **🎯 Per-Library**: Keeps results separate for each of your Rekordbox libraries

### 🎵 **Using the Tool**

#### 📤 **Step 1: Export Your Rekordbox Library**

Before using this tool, you need to export your Rekordbox collection as an XML file:

1. **Open Rekordbox** on your computer
2. **Navigate to File Menu**: 
   - Click **File** in the top menu bar
   - Select **Export Collection in xml format**
   - 
    ![Export Menu](screenshots/export-collection-as-xml.png)

3. **Choose Export Location**:
   - A dialog box will appear
   - Choose where to save your XML file (Desktop is recommended for easy access)
   - Name your file (e.g., "my-library-backup.xml")
   - Click **Save**
   
4. **Wait for Export**:
   - Rekordbox will export your entire collection
   - This may take a few minutes for large libraries (10,000+ tracks)
   - You'll see a progress indicator

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Export your library regularly as a backup! This XML file contains all your playlists, cue points, and track metadata.

#### 📁 **Step 2: Load Your Library**

You can load your library in two convenient ways:

**Option A: Drag & Drop** *(Easy & Fast)*
1. **Launch Rekordbox Library Manager**
2. **Simply drag your XML file** directly onto the application window
3. **Drop it anywhere** on the interface - the app will automatically detect and load it
4. **Wait for parsing** - the tool will analyze your library structure

<img src="screenshots/06-drag-drop-library.png" alt="Drag & Drop Interface" width="600" />

**Option B: Browse for File** *(Traditional)*
1. **Launch Rekordbox Library Manager**
2. **Click "Browse for XML File"** in the main interface  
3. **Select your XML file** from where you saved it
4. **Wait for parsing** - the tool will analyze your library structure

#### 🔍 **Step 3: Find Duplicates**

1. **Go to "Duplicate Detection" tab**
2. **Configure your detection settings** (optional):
   - Choose between Audio Fingerprinting and/or Metadata Matching
   - Select which metadata fields to compare
   - Set path preferences if you have organized folders
3. **Click "Scan for Duplicates"**
4. **Review the results** - duplicates will be grouped by similarity

#### 🛠️ **Step 4: Resolve Duplicates**

1. **Review found duplicates** - each group shows similar tracks
2. **Select which duplicates to resolve** (or use "Select All")
3. **Choose resolution strategy**:
   - **Keep Highest Quality**: Automatically keeps best bitrate/quality
   - **Keep Newest**: Keeps most recently modified files
   - **Keep Preferred Path**: Prioritizes tracks from specific folders
   - **Manual**: Review each duplicate individually
4. **Click "Resolve Selected"** 
5. **Confirm the operation** - a backup will be created automatically

#### 📍 **Step 5: Relocate Missing Tracks** *(Optional)*

If you have tracks showing as "!" (missing) in Rekordbox:

1. **Go to "Track Relocator" tab**
2. **Add search directories** where your music might be located
3. **Configure search settings** (depth, file types, similarity threshold)
4. **Click "Scan for Missing Tracks"**
5. **Review relocation candidates** 
6. **Apply relocations** for the matches you want to fix

#### 📥 **Step 6: Import Back to Rekordbox**

After cleaning your library with this tool, you'll want to import the updated XML back to Rekordbox. Here's the complete process with visual guides:

##### 🎯 **Method 1: Complete Library Replacement** *(Recommended)*

**Step A: Enable XML Import in Rekordbox**

Before you can import XML files, you need to enable the XML import feature in Rekordbox:

1. **Open Rekordbox** 
2. **Go to View Settings**: Navigate to the top menu and access the view preferences
3. **Enable "rekordbox xml" in Tree View**: Make sure the checkbox for "rekordbox xml" is checked

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-1.jpg" alt="Enable XML Import" width="600" />

> **💡 Important**: The "rekordbox xml" option must be enabled in the Tree View section for XML import to work properly.

**Step B: Import Your Cleaned XML File**

1. **Navigate to Database Tab**: Click on the "Database" tab in Rekordbox
2. **Access Library Sync**: Look for the "Library Sync" section 
3. **Select Your Updated XML**: Click "Browse" and select your cleaned XML file (the tool creates a new file with "_cleaned" suffix)

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-2.jpg" alt="Import XML File" width="600" />

4. **Configure Import Options**:
   - ✅ **BPM change points**: Keep this checked to preserve tempo analysis
   - ✅ **Select your updated XML file**: Make sure you're importing the correct cleaned file
5. **Click Import**: Rekordbox will process your cleaned library
6. **Wait for Processing**: This may take several minutes for large libraries

**Step C: Import Your Playlists**

After the XML file is imported, you need to import the playlists:

1. **Navigate to the rekordbox xml section** in the left sidebar
2. **Expand the rekordbox xml tree** to see your imported library
3. **Right-click on "Playlists"** under the rekordbox xml section
4. **Select "Import Playlist"** from the context menu

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-3.jpg" alt="Import Playlists" width="400" />

5. **Confirm the import**: Your playlists will be imported with all tracks properly linked
6. **Verify playlist contents**: Check that all playlists now show the correct track counts

##### ⚠️ **Method 2: Alternative Import Process**

If the above method doesn't work, try this alternative:

1. **In Rekordbox**: Go to **File → Import → Collection** 
2. **Select the updated XML file** 
3. **Choose import options**:
   - ✅ **Replace current collection** (recommended for cleanest results)
   - ⚠️ **Merge with current collection** (if you want to keep existing data)
4. **Wait for import** - Rekordbox will process your cleaned library

##### 🔍 **Verify Your Import**

After importing, verify that everything worked correctly:

1. **Check Playlist Counts**: Your playlists should now show the correct number of tracks (no more empty playlists!)
2. **Verify Duplicate Removal**: Duplicates should be gone from your collection
3. **Test Relocated Tracks**: Previously missing tracks should now play correctly
4. **Check Metadata**: All cues, loops, and beatgrids should be preserved

> **⚠️ Critical Backup Reminder**: Always backup your original Rekordbox database before importing! You can find your Rekordbox database files in:
> - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Pioneer\rekordbox`  
> - **macOS**: `~/Library/Pioneer/rekordbox`
>
> The tool creates XML backups automatically, but backing up your entire Rekordbox database is extra protection.
