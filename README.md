### 🎵 **Using the Tool**

#### 📤 **Step 1: Export Your Rekordbox Library**

Before using this tool, you need to export your Rekordbox collection as an XML file:

1. **Open Rekordbox** on your computer
2. **Navigate to File Menu**: 
   - Click **File** in the top menu bar
   - Select **Export Collection in xml format**
   
   ![Export Menu](screenshots/rekordbox-export-menu.png)
   
3. **Choose Export Location**:
   - A dialog box will appear
   - Choose where to save your XML file (Desktop is recommended for easy access)
   - Name your file (e.g., "my-library-backup.xml")
   - Click **Save**
   
4. **Wait for Export**:
   - Rekordbox will export your entire collection
   - This may take a few minutes for large libraries (10,000+ tracks)
   - You'll see a progress indicator

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Export your library regularly as a backup! This XML file contains all your playlists, cue points, and track metadata.

#### 📁 **Step 2: Load Your Library**

1. **Launch Rekordbox Library Manager**
2. **Click "Load Library"** in the main interface  
3. **Select your XML file** from where you saved it
4. **Wait for parsing** - the tool will analyze your library structure

#### 🔍 **Step 3: Find Duplicates**

1. **Go to "Duplicate Detection" tab**
2. **Configure your detection settings** (optional):
   - Choose between Audio Fingerprinting and/or Metadata Matching
   - Select which metadata fields to compare
   - Set path preferences if you have organized folders
3. **Click "Scan for Duplicates"**
4. **Review the results** - duplicates will be grouped by similarity

#### 🛠️ **Step 4: Resolve Duplicates**

1. **Review found duplicates** - each group shows similar tracks
2. **Select which duplicates to resolve** (or use "Select All")
3. **Choose resolution strategy**:
   - **Keep Highest Quality**: Automatically keeps best bitrate/quality
   - **Keep Newest**: Keeps most recently modified files
   - **Keep Preferred Path**: Prioritizes tracks from specific folders
   - **Manual**: Review each duplicate individually
4. **Click "Resolve Selected"** 
5. **Confirm the operation** - a backup will be created automatically

#### 📍 **Step 5: Relocate Missing Tracks** *(Optional)*

If you have tracks showing as "!" (missing) in Rekordbox:

1. **Go to "Track Relocator" tab**
2. **Add search directories** where your music might be located
3. **Configure search settings** (depth, file types, similarity threshold)
4. **Click "Scan for Missing Tracks"**
5. **Review relocation candidates** 
6. **Apply relocations** for the matches you want to fix
