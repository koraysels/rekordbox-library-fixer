# Implementation Plan - Feature 3: Track Relocation & Repair

**Started:** 2025-08-26T12:30:00Z  
**Source:** IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md + Scaffold Plan  
**Feature Priority:** HIGH - Critical for maintaining library integrity

## Source Analysis

**Source Type:** Implementation plan from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  
**Core Features:**
- Smart file search algorithms with fuzzy matching
- Cloud sync repairs (Dropbox integration)
- Track ownership fixing for grey tracks
- Batch relocation processing
- Directory traversal with filters
- Manual path selection UI

**Dependencies Required:**
- `dropbox` - Dropbox API integration for cloud sync fixes
- `fuzzy-search` - Fuzzy filename matching algorithms
- `glob` - Directory traversal and file pattern matching

**Complexity:** Medium-High (Cloud integration + File system operations)

## Target Integration

**Integration Points:**
- Navigation tabs system ('relocate' tab already defined in types)
- Existing IPC communication pattern
- Logger utility for operation tracking
- Settings store for path preferences
- Notification system for user feedback

**Affected Files:**
- `src/main/trackRelocator.ts` (new)
- `src/main/cloudSyncFixer.ts` (new)  
- `src/main/trackOwnershipFixer.ts` (new)
- `src/renderer/components/TrackRelocator.tsx` (new)
- `src/renderer/hooks/useTrackRelocator.ts` (new)
- `src/renderer/types/index.ts` (update)
- `src/main/preload.ts` (update)
- `src/main/main.ts` (update)

**Pattern Matching:**
- Follow existing IPC handler patterns with safeConsole logging
- Use consistent error handling with success/error result objects
- Match TypeScript interface patterns from existing code
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS with rekordbox theme colors

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Dependencies & Types
- [x] Create implementation session files
- [ ] Install required npm packages
- [ ] Add relocation type definitions

### Phase 2: Main Process Implementation  
- [ ] Create trackRelocator.ts with smart search algorithms
- [ ] Create cloudSyncFixer.ts with Dropbox integration
- [ ] Create trackOwnershipFixer.ts for grey track fixes
- [ ] Add IPC handlers to main.ts
- [ ] Update preload.ts with new IPC channels

### Phase 3: UI Implementation
- [ ] Create useTrackRelocator hook for state management
- [ ] Create TrackRelocator component with relocation UI
- [ ] Integrate with existing navigation system

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test file search algorithms
- [ ] Test cloud sync repair functionality
- [ ] Test ownership fixing
- [ ] Integration testing with existing features
- [ ] Manual testing of complete workflows

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All core relocation features implemented
- [ ] Cloud sync repair working with Dropbox
- [ ] Track ownership fixing operational
- [ ] Smart file search with fuzzy matching
- [ ] Batch operations supported
- [ ] Manual path selection UI complete
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] IPC communication secure
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Integration with navigation tabs working
- [ ] Settings persistence working
- [ ] Performance acceptable for large libraries

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**
- File system permission errors
- Dropbox API authentication issues
- Large library performance impacts
- Cross-platform file path handling

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Git checkpoint before starting
- Git commits at each major milestone
- Graceful fallbacks for cloud sync failures
- Comprehensive error handling and user messaging

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing Logger for all operations
- Follow safeConsole pattern to prevent EPIPE errors
- Integrate with existing settings store for preferences
- Use consistent loading states and error handling
- Follow existing component structure and styling patterns
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
